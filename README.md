## üöÄ Features

* **CSV Upload Interface**
  Upload CSV files containing product data through a clean, minimal Tailwind CSS-based UI.

* **Upload History Tracking**
  View a list of all previous uploads along with their status and upload time.

* **Background Processing**
  Uses **Redis Queue** with **Laravel Horizon** to process files asynchronously without blocking the UI.

* **Real-time Status Updates**
  Status is updated using periodic polling. WebSockets were considered but not used to maintain simplicity.

* **Idempotent Uploads**
  Re-uploading the same file won't create duplicate records.

* **Upsert on Existing Data**
  If a row with the same `UNIQUE_KEY` exists, it's updated instead of inserted.

* **UTF-8 Data Cleaning**
  Automatically cleans any non-UTF-8 characters before processing the data.

## üìÅ CSV File Format

CSV uploads must contain the following headers:

| Field                    |
| ------------------------ |
| UNIQUE\_KEY              |
| PRODUCT\_TITLE           |
| PRODUCT\_DESCRIPTION     |
| STYLE#                   |
| SANMAR\_MAINFRAME\_COLOR |
| SIZE                     |
| COLOR\_NAME              |
| PIECE\_PRICE             |
